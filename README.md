# polyphemus
Polyphemus is a browser-based, polyrhythmic step-sequencer. Its purpose is to allow users to explore rhythmic patterns using a simple, five-instrument interface. Additionally, the application gives users the ability to record and share their patterns with others via Soundcloud, the popular audio sharing platform. If you have never worked with a step-sequencer before, the premise is simple: make music by building rhythmic patterns, one step at a time. Polyphemus is divided into three functional sections: an operation panel sits to the left and features a volume slider and controls for starting and stopping the sequencer; the pattern sequencer and its five patterns occupies the main part of the screen; at the bottom of the application, the pattern storage and recording panel gives the user the ability to save and recall sequencer patterns, as well as to record and automatically upload to Soundcloud.
